## My process

I started out just laying everything out. The challenge had some starter code i had to put into tags. After i got the basic layout done i started to add style to make it look like the part. I designed for mobile first then just used media queries to make it fir for desktop. After all that was done i added the active state to make the website more interactive and then i finished it up with the background image.
